// # Intro Prototypes



// ### Directions

// * Fork this repo
// * Clone it from your github account onto your computer, and switch into the directory
// 	* Make a JS file for each exercise you attempt.
// 	* Play with your code in your snippets or console to verify it works correctly.
// * Once finished do the following:
// 	* `git add . -A` from the prototypes folder.
// 	* `git commit -m 'solutions'`
// 	* `git push origin master`
// * Submit the link to your fork in the homework form.

// | Goal |
// | :--- |
// | Try to complete the **dice**, **starship**, and **radio** problems.|

// **NOTE**: it's very hard to express an exhaustive description of each custom type outlined below. We encourage you to discuss the ambiguity of requirements for **methods** and **properties**. Also, for some exercises, you might need to add a property (or properties) to the prototype in order to make your method work. 

// ## Exercises

// 1. Make a `Dice` constructor that takes a `numberOfSides`. Add a method called `roll` that randomly returns a number from `1` up to the `numberOfSides`.

//   * Modify your `roll` method to record the returned side in a `lastRoll` property.


// 2. Make a `Starship` constructor that takes a `model` and `ownerName`. 
//   * Give your `StarShip` a `setTopSpeed` method and a `getTopSpeed` method that let you change and read the `topSpeed`. *Assume `topSpeed` is just a number.*
//   * Give your `Starship` an `accelerateTo` method that sets `currentSpeed` to some number, unless that number is greater than its `topSpeed`.
 
// 3. Make a `Radio` constructor that takes in an `ownerName` and a `signalType` ("AM" or "FM"). 
//   * Add a `setStation` method to your radio that allows the following ranges for a `station` property:
//     * `535` to `1705` for "AM".
//     * `88` to `108` for "FM".
//   * Add a `listen` method that returns the following:
//     * `"distorted music"` for "AM".
//     * `"clear music"` for "FM".
//   * SUPER BONUS: Add a `toggleSignal` method that lets you set `signalType` to `AM` or `FM`. Make sure the `station` is valid when you toggle. Your radio should remember the `station` from the other signal type when you toggle.
 
// 4. Make a `CardDeck` constructor that returns an object with a `cards` property that is an array of `52` numbers, `1..52`.
// 	* Write a method called `deal`  that randomly returns a "card" (a number from 1 .. 52) from `cards` and removes it from the `cards` array.
// 	* Write a method called `isFull` that returns `true` or `false` if all `52` cards are present.
// 	* Write a method called `cut` that randomly picks an index and returns an array of two arrays where the deck was split at that index.
// 	* BONUS: write a `shuffle` method that mixes up all the cards. How does this change your `deal` method?
	
// 5. Make a `Mailer` constructor that takes a `from` email address, and has `currentMessage` set to an empty object, as well as a `sentMessages` array.
//   * Add a `setSendTo` method that sets `currentMessage.sendTo` to be a specified email.
//   * Add a `setSubject` method that sets `currentMessage.subject` to be a specified subject.
//   * Add a `send` method that sets `currentMessage.from` to be `this.from`, pushes `currentMessage` into `sentMessages`, and sets `currentMessage` to be a new object.
//     * Modify `send` so that it checks if `currentMessage` has both a `sendTo` and `subject` before pushing to `sentMessages`.
